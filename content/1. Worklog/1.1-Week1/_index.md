# **WEEK 1 WORKLOG**

### **Week 1 Objectives**

* Understand and practice core AWS IAM concepts (Users, Groups, Roles, Policies).
* Learn to deploy and manage Amazon EC2 (Launch instances, Security Groups, Snapshots, AMIs).
* Implement a high-availability and auto-scaling architecture using Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Auto Scaling Group (ASG).
* Understand and apply IAM Roles as a secure method for EC2 to access other AWS services (like S3).

### **Week 1 Achievements**

* Mastered basic concepts and practical operations of **AWS IAM**, understanding the differences between Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies.
* Successfully deployed and managed **Amazon EC2** virtual machines, including:
    * Launching instances from different AMIs (Linux, Windows).
    * Installing and configuring a basic Apache web server.
    * Backing up and cloning instances using Snapshots and AMIs.
* Understood and proficiently configured **Security Groups** to secure instances, applying the Principle of Least Privilege.
* Deployed a complete high-availability (HA) and auto-scaling architecture by combining:
    * **Launch Templates** for instance consistency.
    * **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for traffic distribution.
    * **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** to automatically add/remove instances based on CPU load.
* Understood and applied the security best practice of using **IAM Roles** for EC2 to interact with S3, avoiding long-term access keys.
* Improved skills using the AWS Management Console and basic AWS CLI commands.
